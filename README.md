An unofficial implementation of algorithms and concepts presented in the seminal work on 
artificial intelligenceâ€“**Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach**.

This project does not aim to do a better job than what is already done in the official repository
complementing the book, the code here is more like an educational enterprise, a playground even.

The plan is to go through the book and implement all the various algorithms and data structures presented,
the official code base is seldom referenced but in general the code here is as unique as possible.
